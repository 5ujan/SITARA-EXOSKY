# Sitara 

Sitara is an innovative educational tool that allows users to explore and experience the night sky as seen from a variety of exoplanets discovered by astronomers and space missions. By seamlessly integrating data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive with the detailed star positions from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue, Sitara visualises the unique star patterns visible from these distant worlds, providing a distinct perspective on the galaxy. Unlike traditional star maps familiar to Earth-based observers, Sitara offers a completely different celestial experience—one that mirrors how the stars and constellations appear from exoplanets across the gala
In addition to visualising the exoplanet night sky, Sira offers an interactive star chart tool where users can draw and name their own constellations, just as ancient astronomers once did on Earth. This not only engages users in scientific inquiry but also gives them the freedom to creatively interpret the alien night skies.

## Features 
ExoSky addresses offers the following key features:
- **Exoplanet Visualization:** Users can select an exoplanet from a growing database, accessing detailed information about its host star, distance from Earth, and other astronomical properties. 
- **3D Star Map:** Using parallax data and star positions from the Gaia DR3 catalogue, ExoSky offers a 360-degree fisheye rendering of the exoplanet’s night sky. This map accounts for shifts in star positions due to the planet's unique location, creating a realistic depiction of the night sky.
- **Interactive Exploration:** Users can interact with the star map with orbital controls, tracing constellations, and receiving detailed information on star properties.
- **Constellation Creation:** Much like the early astronomers who mapped the sky from Earth, users can draw their own constellations between stars visible from their chosen exoplanet. These custom constellations can be named and saved, allowing users to create their own myths and stories inspired by the alien night sky.
